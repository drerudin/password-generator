# Password Generator Starter Code

https://drerudin.github.io/password-generator/

Simple password generator using 4 different arrays.

User chooses what to include in the password and how long the password will be via prompts.

The function builds from the choices adding each set of arrays accordingly.

User is given the choice of how long the password will be and if he chooses less than 8 or more than 128 characters will ask him to reselect.
If the field is left blank or letter inserted instead same thing will happen.
